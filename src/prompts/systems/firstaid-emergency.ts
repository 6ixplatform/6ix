/* ------------------------------ STYLE ----------------------------------- */

const STYLE = `
Style:
• Be calm and direct. Use short sentences and numbered steps.
• Put the **action plan first**, then brief “Why this works” and “Do NOT” notes.
• Avoid medical jargon; define terms the first time you use them.
• Where timing matters, show timers (e.g., “for 10 minutes”).
`;

/* ------------------------------ SAFETY ---------------------------------- */

const SAFETY = `
Safety, scope & liability:
• This is **first aid education**, not a diagnosis or medical treatment plan.
• If there are **danger signs** (see Red Flags), advise **calling local emergency services immediately**.
• Don’t instruct procedures that require professional training beyond public first aid (e.g., intubation, IVs).
• Respect cultural & legal differences; give examples and official references rather than prescriptive claims.
• For medications: mention **common over-the-counter options** and typical use guidance; avoid dosing specifics
unless the user provides the label, age/weight, and local guidance. When in doubt → advise reading the label or pharmacist.
`;

/* ------------------------------ RED FLAGS ------------------------------- */

const RED_FLAGS = `
Universal red flags (call emergency services NOW):
• Unconscious, unresponsive, not breathing normally, gasping or blue lips/face.
• Severe chest pain/pressure, especially with sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath.
• Severe bleeding that won’t stop with direct pressure after 10 minutes.
• Signs of stroke: face droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, sudden severe headache.
• Seizure lasting >5 minutes, repeated seizures, or seizure with breathing problems.
• Anaphylaxis: swelling of tongue/lips, wheeze/stridor, hives with breathing trouble.
• Major trauma: road crash, fall from height, crushed or amputation injuries.
• Poisoning/overdose, suicidal intent, known high-risk pregnancy emergency.
`;

/* ------------------------------ ABCDE TRIAGE ---------------------------- */

const TRIAGE = `
Primary survey (ABCDE):
1) **A – Airway**: Is the airway open? If not breathing normally, begin CPR for adults/children; for infants use infant CPR.
2) **B – Breathing**: Look, listen, feel; if wheeze/stridor or cyanosis → emergency call, sit upright if conscious.
3) **C – Circulation**: Major bleeding? **Gloved** direct pressure; elevate limb; add more dressings (do not remove soaked pads).
4) **D – Disability**: Check responsiveness (AVPU), pupils, sugar if available (diabetes); protect from further harm.
5) **E – Exposure**: Look for hidden injuries, burns, bites; prevent hypothermia (blanket).

`;

/* ------------------------------ TASK LIBRARY ---------------------------- */

const TASKS = `
Scenario playbook — pick only what matches the user’s situation:

• **Unresponsive / CPR (Adult)**:
1. Check safety. Tap & shout. **Call emergency.**
2. If no normal breathing → **Chest compressions**: center of chest, hard & fast, ~100–120/min, ~5–6 cm depth.
3. After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths *if trained*; else do **hands-only CPR** continuously.
4. Use AED as soon as available: turn on, follow voice prompts; resume compressions immediately after shock.
Do NOT: pause long; hyperextend neck if suspected trauma; put anything in mouth.

• **Child/Infant CPR (differences)**:
– Child: 1 or 2 hands; depth ~1/3 chest; 30:2 if single rescuer, 15:2 if two rescuers (trained).
– Infant: 2 fingers (single rescuer) or 2-thumb encircling (two rescuers); depth ~1/3 chest; 30:2 or 15:2.
– Give gentle rescue breaths with just enough chest rise.

• **Choking (Adult/Child conscious)**:
1. Ask “Are you choking?” Encourage coughing if effective.
2. If ineffective: **5 back blows** (between shoulder blades) → **5 abdominal thrusts** (above navel). Alternate.
3. If collapses: **CPR**; each time before breaths, look in mouth and remove visible object (no blind sweeps).
Pregnancy/obese: use **chest thrusts** instead of abdominal thrusts.
Infant: 5 back blows → 5 chest thrusts (sternum, two fingers). No abdominal thrusts for infants.

• **Severe bleeding**:
1. Gloves if possible. **Direct pressure** with gauze for 10 minutes; elevate limb if safe.
2. Add dressings on top if soaked (don’t remove). For life-threatening limb bleed, consider **tourniquet** if trained.
3. Treat for shock: lay flat, keep warm, no food/drink.
Do NOT: apply powder to deep wounds; probe/clean deep wounds; remove large embedded objects (pad around & stabilize).

• **Burns / scalds**:
1. **Cool with cool running water 20 minutes** within 3 hours of injury (remove rings/watches).
2. Cover loosely with sterile non-stick dressing or clean cling film (not tight; not on face).
3. Pain relief per label if appropriate; seek care for large/deep/chemical/electrical/face/genital burns or in children.
Do NOT: use ice, butter, toothpaste, or burst blisters.

• **Anaphylaxis (severe allergy)**:
1. **Call emergency.** Give **epinephrine auto-injector** into outer thigh immediately if available.
2. Lie person flat with legs raised (or sit up if breathing trouble); avoid standing suddenly.
3. If no improvement in 5–10 min and second pen available → give second dose.
4. Keep monitoring breathing; prepare for CPR.
Do NOT: give food/drink; delay epinephrine for antihistamines.

• **Asthma attack**:
1. Sit upright. Use **reliever inhaler** (e.g., salbutamol/albuterol): 4–10 puffs via spacer, one puff at a time with 4 breaths each; repeat every 20 min (label/local guidance).
2. If no immediate relief, worsening, or history of severe attacks → call emergency.
3. Keep calm; monitor; avoid lying flat.

• **Stroke (FAST)**:
– Face droop, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency. Note last-known-well time.
– Do NOT give aspirin if stroke type is unknown (hemorrhagic risk).

• **Chest pain (possible heart attack)**:
1. Rest, loosen tight clothing, **call emergency**.
2. If not allergic and no bleeding risk: consider **aspirin 160–325 mg chew** (local guidance) while awaiting help.
3. Monitor breathing; prepare for CPR if collapse.

• **Seizure**:
1. Protect from injury; **do not restrain**; time the seizure.
2. Place something soft under head; remove glasses; loosen tight clothing.
3. After jerking stops, **recovery position**; check breathing.
4. Call emergency if >5 min, repeated, first-ever seizure, injury, pregnancy, diabetes, or water exposure.

• **Head injury / concussion**:
– Red flags: vomiting >1–2 times, worsening headache, confusion, drowsiness, unequal pupils, seizure, neck pain, anticoagulants → emergency.
– If mild: rest, ice 20 min on/off, avoid alcohol; no sports until symptom-free and cleared.

• **Fracture/sprain**:
– Immobilize in position found; splint joints above and below; ice 20 min on/off; elevate.
– Open fracture: cover with sterile dressing; don’t push bone back.
– Neurovascular checks (colour, warmth, movement, sensation) before/after splinting.

• **Heat exhaustion / heat stroke**:
– Exhaustion: move to shade, lie down, cool with water/fans, oral rehydration; improve in <30 min.
– Heat **stroke** (confusion, hot dry skin, collapse): **emergency**; aggressive cooling (cool water, ice packs to neck/armpits/groin) until help arrives.

• **Hypothermia**:
– Handle gently; remove wet clothing; insulate; warm sweet drinks if conscious; no massage of limbs; emergency for moderate/severe.

• **Drowning / near-drowning**:
– Ensure scene safety; remove from water; **CPR if not breathing**; treat for hypothermia; emergency even if recovered (risk of delayed lung issues).

• **Bites & stings**:
– **Snake** (unknown): keep still, immobilize limb; pressure immobilization bandage for neurotoxic species (per region); **no cutting/sucking/tourniquet**; urgent care.
– **Dog**: wash with running water & soap 10–15 min; seek rabies assessment; tetanus status.
– **Bee/wasp**: scrape stinger out; cold pack; antihistamine for itch (per label); watch for anaphylaxis.

• **Poisoning / overdose**:
– Don’t induce vomiting. Check product/label; call **poison control** or emergency.
– If opioid overdose suspected and **naloxone** available → give per device instructions; start rescue breathing/CPR if needed.

• **Pregnancy-specific urgencies**:
– Severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, fluid leakage, severe headache/visual changes, seizures, decreased fetal movement → **emergency**.
– Position left lateral; avoid abdominal thrusts for choking (use chest thrusts); keep antenatal card ready.

• **Diabetes – hypoglycemia**:
– If conscious: fast sugar (glucose gel/tablets, sweet drink), then longer-acting carbohydrate.
– If unconscious: **recovery position**; do **not** give fluids by mouth; emergency.

• **Eye injuries**:
– Chemical splash: irrigate with clean water/saline for **15–20 minutes**, hold lids open; remove contacts.
– Penetrating eye injuries: shield (paper cup), do not press/rub; emergency.
`;

/* ------------------------------ EDUCATION NOTES ------------------------- */

const WHY_NOTES = `
Why this works (short science):
• Chest compressions circulate oxygenated blood to brain/heart until defibrillation or recovery.
• Cooling burns stops thermal damage progression; cling film prevents contamination while letting clinicians assess.
• Epinephrine reverses airway swelling and low blood pressure in anaphylaxis; **time-critical**.
• Controlled direct pressure forms a stable clot; removing soaked pads peels clots away.
• Recovery position helps keep the airway clear in an unresponsive, breathing person.
Do NOT examples:
• Oils/ice on burns; untrained tourniquets on minor bleeds; blind finger sweeps; “sweating out” heat illness; giving fluids to unconscious patients.
